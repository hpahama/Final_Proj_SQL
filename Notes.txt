Initial Data Cleaning

Checked for missing values in the Happiness dataset: No missing values were found after cleaning.
Checked for duplicate rows: There were no duplicates.
Verified that the data looked fine and saved the cleaned data as a CSV file.
Adjustments

Cleaned the second dataset:
Converted land percentage to decimal format.
Removed dollar signs from gasoline prices.
Removed commas from population values using Excel.
Column Management

Dropped unnecessary columns and renamed others to remove spaces (e.g., replaced spaces with underscores).
Data Type Adjustments

Converted percentage columns to decimal format.
Issue Encountered

Ran into a "zero bites" error when trying to load the cleaned data into SQL.
Decided to focus on the 2023 data and dropped data from other years.
SQL Table Creation

Created tables in SQL:
Countries table with a primary key (country_id) as a serial number.
Economic table linked to the Countries table using a foreign key (country_id).
Other tables like Geography and Happiness, with relevant columns and references.
Data Mismatch

Identified mismatched countries between datasets and dropped rows for countries present in one dataset but not the other.
After cleaning, both datasets had 93 rows each.
Query Examples

Ran queries to find countries with the highest combined happiness score, minimum wage, and GDP.
Also explored countries with high happiness scores and low perceptions of corruption (e.g., New Zealand).
Found correlation between GDP, urban population, and happiness scores in top-ranking countries like the U.S., China, and Germany.
Data Insights

Explored possible correlations between happiness scores and minimum wage, urban population, and GDP.
Considered adding questions about tax revenue, tax rates, and their correlation with perceptions of corruption or happiness.
Issues with Generosity Data

Encountered negative values in generosity data (possibly due to perception issues) and opted not to use it in analysis.
Database Structure

Suggested breaking the large economic table into smaller tables for better organization.
Contemplated moving population and urban population data to a separate table to reduce clutter in the economic table.
Additional Queries

Mentioned using R visualizations to further explore the data, but not immediately possible due to time constraints.
Next Steps

Refined the database structure and data cleaning methods for better organization and clarity.
Considered sharing a link for collaboration on the project and further refinement.

Questions for the problem set:
Demographics:
- Countries with the highest GDP, happiness ladder score, and an urban population exceeding 50% of the total population.
  - This question examines demographic factors like the urban population size alongside GDP and happiness.

- Correlation between generosity and happiness ladder score.
  - This explores how generosity, a demographic/social behavior, correlates with happiness scores in different countries.

Geographical:
- Country with the highest happiness score and the lowest perception of corruption.
  - Focuses on finding a country (geographical focus) with specific social characteristics, linking happiness and corruption perception.

Economical:
- Top countries with the highest combined happiness ladder score, minimum wage, and GDP.
  - Focuses on the relationship between happiness, economic factors like minimum wage, and GDP.

- Country with the highest minimum wage and a high overall happiness ladder score.
  - Investigates the relationship between high minimum wage and high happiness.

- Correlation between minimum wage and happiness ladder score across countries.
  - Looks at how minimum wage (an economic factor) correlates with happiness scores.

- How tax revenue or tax rates affect the perception of corruption or happiness ladder score.
  - Analyzes how economic factors like tax policies influence corruption and happiness.
